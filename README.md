### General Info
***
Forest Churches is not just an application, its a movement! Based on the idea of uniting churches in the Forest Of Dean, forest churches is a web application designed to help point people to church and ultimately the ultimate source of life! 

Built using .NET 8.0 - ASP.NET, the forest church app focuses on uniting churches, no matter their denomination, leaders or issues. We are all united in Christ! 

The application will feature a 'NearBy' feature, which will take a users post code and return a list of churches within 5 miles, including key information such as; 
  * The Church Name
  * The Address
  * The Phone Number 
  * The Website

Each church will have their own profile where they can view and manage their account as well as upload their events for users to find on the system.
